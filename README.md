## General Information
- Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.
- The project is done to predict the count - target variable of the bike company from the numerous other variables 
- The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- 1.The model has the R2 value as 81.7% the model is able to explains the variance accurently on the test set 
- 2.The mean squre error of the test and the train set both are near to 0
- 3.we can say that boombike company is dependent on temperature and if its a working day or not , the demand is more in summer and spring when compared     to winter
